This project is an individual project that I began after my initial programming introductory course. It is mostly a proof of concept and a learning opportunity for myself as I began learning web-development and how to interact with APIs. It began as a Python only backend manual entry food tracker and has become a functioning web application. Currently I am not sharing my fatSecret class used for API access. In the future I plan to have a public access token but in the meantime this will be restricted. While it may not function for those cloning, hopefully it is still a good resource for ideas. Expect a lot of changes to come to the project.
