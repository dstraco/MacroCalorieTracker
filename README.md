This project is an individual project that I began after my initial programming introductory course. It began as a Python only backend manual entry food tracker and has become a functioning web application. Currently I am not sharing my class used for API access although it should be apperent where it is used in the program. In the future I am plan to have a demo key or some sort of public access token but in the meantime this will be restricted. While it may not function for those stopping in, hopefully it is still a good resource for ideas and will serve as a portion of my portfolio. Expect a lot of changes to come to the project. I am currently implementing JavaScript throughout the program and getting rid of any non-static HTML.
